## TJ NMLO Public Dataset Fruits Classification Project

USING Keras, atik, and Jupyter
Activate virtual environment that contains all of the software packages necessary using: `source /usr/swat/bin/CS63env`
    To leave the virtual environment, type: `deactivate`

We are using Jupyter Lab to enable interactive experiments with our deep networks. Once the virtual environment is activated, cd to the directory containing the repo for this project, and then start up jupyter with the command: `jupyter-lab`

To leave jupyter, shut down the kernels and close out of the browser window. In addition, in the terminal window where jupyter was started, press __CTRL+C__

Some images may not pop up when using “Run all cells” but when selecting the specific cell block and running __Shift+Enter__ it will pop up.

Within jupyter, open the file _fruits.ipynb_ and read through the notebook.

To test the code, in the menu on the top left of the screen, choose Run→Run All Cells. 

You can also run the cells individually by clicking __Shift+Enter__ (recommended)

__NOTE:__ 
Printing the images of the fruits and their associated names will not always occur when running all of the cells at once. If you want to see a subset of images of the initial training data, run the cells individually. 
If you choose to run all cells at once, the confusion matrices may take a few seconds to generate after all the notebook has finished completely running.
